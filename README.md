# Junior Front End Assessment

Improve the form to upload a new document.

Current implementation is intentionally messy. It should be cleaned up, and rewritten to produce concise, re-usable, maintainable HTML+CSS.

**Note: The page does not need to be functional - we only want to see HTML and CSS.**

## Running with NPM

The example has been prepared to run on Linux or MacOS using npm.

```
npm install
npm start
```

If you are on Windows, run:

```
npm run start-windows
```

Open your browser at http://localhost:8081/ to view the page.

When you make a change it will take short while to copy the new HTML or compile the updated SCSS.
You must refresh the page manually to see your changes.

Good luck!
